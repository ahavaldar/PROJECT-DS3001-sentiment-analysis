Oklahoma faith community to discuss climate and environmentThe Daily Oklahoman (Oklahoma City, OK)October 31, 2015 SaturdayCopyright 2015 The Daily Oklahoman, All Rights ReservedLength:Ê801 wordsByline:ÊBy Carla Hinton Religion Editor , chinton@oklahoman.comBodyWhen Pope Francis released his encyclical on the environment in June, his challenge to leaders and people around the world brought issues such as climate control and global warming to the forefront."Humanity still has the ability to protect our common home," the pope wrote.The Rev. Tim Luschen, pastor of St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, said the topics had been bandied about for years, but when the pope gave voice to his concern about such issues, many people in faith communities became interested in discussing them."It caused people to hear the message again in a new way," Luschen said.The environment will be the topic of "An Evening of Listening: Climate Change Is Real," set for 6:30 p.m. Thursday at St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, 127 NW 7. Luschen will serve as moderator, and panelists will include Pat Hoerth with Turtle Rock Farm; the Rev. Deborah Meinke, Cimarron Presbytery clerk; and Jim Roth, with Phillips Murrah Law Firm.&nbsp;Organizers of the forum, co-sponsored by St. Paul's and the Oklahoma Conference of Churches, said participants will discuss the "myths of climate change, the science of climate change, the theology of the stewardship of the environment and the legal issues that effect the climate."Luschen said Francis, in his encyclical, called for people to be good stewards of the Earth, "not that we are to be masters of it so much as keepers of it - the 'tenders of the garden.' "Luschen said the pope and others who have voiced concerns about climate change point to environmental crises such as long periods of drought, floods and countries fighting over supply and control of fossil fuels.&nbsp;"He's saying all these things are connected," the priest said.Johnson Bridgewater, executive director of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, said he's pleased to see the local faith community begin public dialogue on climate change and other environmental issues."When you see someone like the pope mentioning climate change, it becomes much harder to ignore," Bridgewater said.'Inextricably linked'But Bridgewater said other leaders and faith groups also have voiced concerns and issued statements about climate change in recent months. The United Methodist Church has issued statements expressing concerns about climate change in recent years, he said.&nbsp;Also, Bridgewater said, a large contingent of Muslim clerics and religious scholars meeting in August at the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium in Instanbul issued an "Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change." According to news reports, the declaration was a statement about the role Muslims should play in the efforts to combat climate change.And this week, 15 prominent Buddhists leaders issued a statement titled "The Buddhist Climate Change Statement to World Leaders," calling for the world's political leaders to adopt an effective climate change agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference set for Nov. 30-Dec. 11 in Paris."Everyday life can easily lead us to forget that we are inextricably linked to the natural world through every breath we take, the water we drink and the food we eat," Lama Lobzang, secretary of the International Buddhist Confederation, said in a prepared statement."Humanity must act on the root causes of this crisis, which is driven by greed, thoughtlessness and a lack of concern about the consequences of our actions."&nbsp;Bridgewater said it is key that many of the world's moral and ethical leaders are calling for solutions to what they perceive is a climate change crisis, especially when there are those who dispute the entire notion of climate change and global warming."It isn't about one particular faith or one particular religion. Ultimately, they can make a vital difference, because when you put all of them behind the idea of stewardship and protecting the Earth, people listen," he said.Related eventsMeanwhile, Bridgewater said people of faith will have other opportunities in the coming weeks to increase their knowledge about climate change and show their concern.Monday, an Interfaith Prayer Vigil for Solar Power in Oklahoma will be held outside the Jim Thorpe building, which houses the Oklahoma Corporation Commission office. Organizers said the event is for all who care about energy choice and decreasing Oklahoma's carbon footprint.The prayer event is co-sponsored by the Oscar Romero Catholic Worker House, Oklahoma Interfaith Power and Light and the Oklahoma United Methodist Environmental Coalition.Also, Bridgewater said a film about climate change and the economy will have a screening Dec. 1 at Quail Springs AMC Theater. Sponsors of the screening of "This Changes Everything," based upon the book by Naomi Klein, include Transition OKC, Sierra Club, Peace House and the Oklahoma Conference of Churches.ClassificationLanguage:ÊENGLISHPublication-Type:ÊNewspaperSubject:ÊCATHOLIC POPES (90%); CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (90%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); RELIGION (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (89%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (89%); BUDDHISTS & BUDDHISM (78%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (78%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); THEOLOGY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); EXECUTIVES (73%); NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS (73%); DROUGHT (69%); ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (68%)Industry:ÊGLOBAL WARMING (77%); ENERGY & UTILITIES (73%)Person:ÊPOPE FRANCIS I (73%)Geographic:ÊOKLAHOMA, USA (94%); EARTH (79%)Load-Date:ÊNovember 3, 2015End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 3 of 3Oklahoma faith community to discuss climate and environment
