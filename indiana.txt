Bipartisan action, leadership on climate changeSouth Bend Tribune (Indiana)December 5, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 South Bend Tribune Corporation All Rights ReservedSection:ÊA; Pg. 5Length:Ê685 wordsByline:ÊDelaina WilkinBodyRight now it might feel as if our country has been split in two. This election has divided friends, neighbors and families. Personally, it has caused many heated arguments between my father and myself. How can we mend this political dysfunction to move forward as a nation? By remembering that whether red, blue or purple there is more that unites us than divides us. We all want health, safety and security. After the dust settles, we will hug and forgive our friends and family and remember that we love each other. As a nation we must do the same thing. Our elected government officials must shake hands across the aisle; demonstrate bipartisanship and work to find solutions that benefit all of us.Indiana Sen. Mike Braun has demonstrated an excellent example of such bipartisanship leadership to tackle a problem that affects all Americans. As a co-founding member of the Senate Climate Caucus, Braun, R-Ind., along with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., brought together seven Republicans and seven Democrats including Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to address climate change. At first it was surprising to me that these senators who so often appear intensely divided could actually collaborate. But they have been working together and state that the aim of the caucus is to find common ground on climate solutions that will solidify American leadership, promote opportunities for American workers, and protect the environment for generations to come. Braun has said, "Through this caucus we can have real conversations about protecting our environment, securing our energy future and protecting jobs."In addition, Braun, along with Sens. Stabenow, Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., has introduced the bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act. This bill will break down barriers for farmers and foresters to voluntarily participate in carbon markets so they can be financially rewarded for climate-smart practices. A parallel bill was subsequently introduced into the House of Representatives with immense bipartisan support. In October the bill reached 20 co-sponsors, 11 Democrats and nine Republicans including Indiana Reps. James Baird and Trey Hollingsworth.As a proud Hoosier, I believe that Indiana with its factories, farms and universities is set up to be a front-runner in our nation for climate action. I applaud Braun and Congressmen Baird and Hollingsworth for reaching across the aisle to find workable solutions that will benefit Hoosiers. I hope that other Indiana representatives at all levels including Sen. Todd Young and our district's Congresswoman Jackie Walorski consider this same level of leadership.Historically, climate change has been a politically divisive issue, but the literal and figurative winds are changing. Most Americans now understand that climate change is a threat to our health, safety and economic security. It is not just the dated image of tree hugging, Birkenstock wearers who are demonstrating for the environment.On the rise are conservative groups such as the Young Republicans and Christian environmentalists who are pushing the GOP for a meaningful climate plan. In addition, non-partisan advocacy groups such as Citizens Climate Lobby are working in the "Far Middle" with both Democrats and Republicans to promote climate action legislation.My father and I remain at the opposing ends of the red-blue spectrum. Have we been able to forgive and reach common ground? Yes, because we both want the same thing for our children, grandchildren and future generations - a safe, healthy and secure planet.Can we heal as a nation? Yes, because we all want these same things. Yes, as American we have more that unites than divides us. And yes, because it is already happening."We come from different political parties and represent different parts of the country, but we recognize the importance of American leadership in addressing our changing climate. Republicans and Democrats have to work together, compromise, and find common ground." - Senate Climate Caucus.Delaina Wilkin is a member of the Citizens Climate Lobby.
