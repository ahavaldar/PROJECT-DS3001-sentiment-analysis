Thompson and Lubben drew conclusions based on existing governmental data and private sector studies of proposed cap-and-trade legislation.Even though cap-and-trade is politically dead, the Environmental Protection Agency has started regulating carbon emissions, John McCollister, Platte Institute executive director, said. Such regulation will increase energy costs nationally and in Nebraska, the investigators found.A spokesman for a national wildlife organization conceded there would be a cost to regulating greenhouse gases. But there also would be a cost to doing nothing, possibly a much greater one."What happens to the agricultural sector with increased drought, increased flooding, more extreme weather?" asked Tony Iallonardo, senior communications manager for the National Wildlife Federation. "If those things aren't accounted for, we really haven't accounted for the full costs of climate change."The study found that climate change regulations wouldn't shrink Nebraska's economy but would lead to decreased growth. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation and electrical generation, which release the most carbon into the atmosphere, would bear the largest burden, Thompson said.Meanwhile, Lubben said,"the end result for agriculture appears to be a mixed story."Higher energy costs would drive up the costs of fuel, fertilizer and pesticides, which could lead to a single-digit percentage cut in short-term farm income. But crop and livestock producers also could benefit if regulations lead to higher biofuel prices and create markets for carbon sequestration.Such benefits could outpace input increases, Lubben's analysis found.The institute study did not factor in the costs of a warmer planet because such costs are uncertain, Thompson said. He did not dispute the existence of global warming, but he said it was extremely difficult to quantify how it might affect the economy in the long term.And if the consequences turn out to be less dire than some predict, the regulatory drag on the economy will have been for naught, he said.The National Wildlife Federation spokesman said hoping for the best ignored scientific evidence."We've just had the hottest year on record, and we've just had the hottest decade on record," Iallonardo said. "If policymakers want to make decisions based on a small minority of scientists,many of whom are industry-financed, they're in for a rude awakening."McCollister declined to say how much the institute paid for the study, but he said he did not edit the investigators' findings."We had control over what we studied and what we wrote," Lubben said.Reach Joe Duggan at 402-473-7239 or jduggan@journalstar.comClassificationLanguage:ÊENGLISHPublication-Type:ÊNewspaperSubject:ÊGREENHOUSE GASES (99%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (90%); ECONOMICS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (90%); BUSINESS NEWS (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); WILDLIFE (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (88%); AGRICULTURAL INCOME (78%); AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (78%); CARBON CAPTURE & STORAGE (78%); CONSERVATION (78%); CONSERVATISM (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); OIL & GAS PRICES (78%); PRICES (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (78%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (78%); AGRICULTURAL PRICES (76%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (75%); FLOODS & FLOODING (75%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (73%); SEVERE WEATHER (73%); WEATHER (73%); EXECUTIVES (71%); PESTICIDES (70%)Company:Ê BUREAU OF BUSINESS PRACTICE (57%)Organization:ÊUNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA (57%); NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION (54%)Industry:ÊSIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING & PRINTING (57%); AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING & HUNTING (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); AGRICULTURAL INCOME (78%); AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); BIOMASS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); MANUFACTURING (78%); OIL & GAS PRICES (78%); AGRICULTURAL PRICES (76%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (75%); FERTILIZERS (75%); BIOFUELS (73%); LIVESTOCK (73%); AGRICULTURE (70%); ANIMAL FARMING & BREEDING (70%); PESTICIDES (70%)Geographic:ÊLINCOLN, NE, USA (79%); OMAHA, NE, USA (73%); NEBRASKA, USA (95%)Load-Date:ÊJanuary 5, 2011End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 4 of 4Analysis says climate rules to slow growth;
