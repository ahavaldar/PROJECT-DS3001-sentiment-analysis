POWER SHIFT TEXAS MONTHLYSeptember 2019Copyright 2019 TEXAS MONTHLY, INC. All Rights ReservedSection:ÊFEATURES; Pg. 100Length:Ê586 wordsByline:ÊA manifesto by Michael E. WebberHighlight:ÊThe future of the economy, and the planet, is low-carbon. So where does that leave frack-happy, oil-blessed Texas? If we're smart (and our politicians don't screw it up), we can lead the way and get rich doing it.BodyThe energy industry has been good to Texas ever since oil gushed from Spindletop in 1901-and Texas has been good to the world. Blessed with an abundance of hydrocarbons, we prospered mightily, created millions of good jobs, and helped the Allies win World War II. Our technical know-how, risk-taking spirit, and vast resources have sparked innovations that have spread across the globe and bank-rolled many of the institutions-universities, museums, public parks-that enrich our public life. In an era when carbon emissions didn't matter, Texas was king of the energy world.But climate change threatens to knock us off the throne. Scientists have reached a consensus about the need to quickly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in order to slow Earth's warming. Texas's historic energy production over the past century-and our ability to manufacture products like chemicals and refined fuels that the rest of the world wants-came at a price. And today the bill for decades of spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has come due. We can see the costs near (record-breaking rainfall during Hurricane Harvey, killer heat waves and droughts, an increasing number of climate refugees from places like Central America) and far (melting polar ice, dying coral reefs). Neither the world nor Texas can continue to do business the way we always have.Texas is, by far, the nation's largest polluter. We emit nearly twice as much carbon dioxide as the country's second-highest polluter, California, even though the Golden State's population is 40 percent greater. If we were a country, we would be the seventh-largest CO2 emitter in the world: just below manufacturing-intensive Germany, and higher than Canada and Australia. Our post-WWII economy was built upon polluting industries, so at first blush people worry that reducing emissions will hobble the economy. But that worry is misplaced.The good news is that Texas doesn't have to choose between environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. Our economy is much more diversified than it was decades ago. As the world shifts to less-carbon-intensive forms of energy, Texas can lead the way. We can deploy our vast expanses of open land-buffeted by wind, bathed in sunshine, and saturated with natural gas-to help the world end its addiction to coal and transition to a low-carbon future. There's a new kind of boom already underway in Texas, and it could define us as profoundly as Spindletop.The bad news is that much of our political leadership stubbornly insists that the best path to sustain our energy sector is to deny the perils of climate change, subsidize coal, and abandon the policies that the federal government has frequently used to speed up innovation. But such politicians are behind the times. The Texas energy sector has evolved into something far different than its caricature. It's more complex, more diverse, and better prepared for the future than policymakers and lobbyists care to admit.After decades of foot-dragging and delay tactics that postponed action on climate change, name-brand multinational energy companies such as Shell and ExxonMobil have broken with independent oil companies to call for policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including a carbon tax and the regulation of methane emissions.Riding the latest trends and harnessing our outsized ability to produce energy and deploy technologies at scale, Texas can maintain its leadership position. We just need policymakers to help, not hinder, our low-carbon future.Graphic Photo, illustrations by PABLO DELCAN AND JUSTIN METZClassificationLanguage:ÊENGLISHPublication-Type:ÊMagazineSubject:ÊGREENHOUSE GASES (99%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (89%); HURRICANE HARVEY (79%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION (78%); INDUSTRY & ENVIRONMENT (78%); POPULATION SIZE (78%); WORLD WAR II (77%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (76%); DROUGHT (75%); EXTREME TEMPERATURES (75%); GLACIERS & ICEBERGS (75%); HEAT WAVES (75%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (73%); SUSTAINABILITY (73%); REFUGEES (72%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (71%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); SEVERE WEATHER (70%); ISLANDS & REEFS (69%); HURRICANES (66%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (60%)Industry:ÊELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY & UTILITY TRADE (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (89%); ENERGY & UTILITIES (89%); ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (89%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); MANUFACTURING (78%); NATURAL GAS (78%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (71%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (60%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (56%)Geographic:ÊTEXAS, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%); EARTH (79%); AUSTRALIA (79%); CANADA (79%); GERMANY (79%)Load-Date:ÊNovember 16, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 3 of 3POWER SHIFT
