Strong tornadoes not linked to climate change, experts sayThe Daily Oklahoman (Oklahoma City, OK)December 12, 2013 ThursdayCopyright 2013 The Daily Oklahoman, All Rights ReservedSection:ÊNEWS; Pg. 9ALength:Ê675 wordsByline:ÊBY CHRIS CASTEELBodyWASHINGTON ‰?" No evidence exists that climate change has led to more tornadoes or stronger ones, experts said Wednesday at a House hearing exploring the links between global warming and severe weather events.‰??Tornadoes in the United States have not increased in frequency, intensity or normalized damage since 1950,‰? said Roger Pielke Jr., the director of the Center of Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado.‰??And based on research we‰??ve done, there‰??s some evidence in fact that they‰??ve actually declined ‰?" the strongest tornadoes.‰?Pielke was one of three researchers from U.S. universities who testified before a House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee about severe weather and climate change. The Republican-controlled subcommittee sought to debunk oft-cited claims that climate change has contributed to severe droughts and storms in recent years.Two of the witnesses, Pielke and University of Alabama researcher John Christy, have been criticized by some environmentalists for their views on climate change. Both dismissed any link between climate change and hurricanes, droughts, tornadoes and floods.‰??To label today‰??s events as extreme usually fails the test of time,‰? said Christy.The third witness, retired U.S. Navy Admiral David Titley, now at Penn State University, acknowledged that a direct link couldn‰??t be made between climate change and any particular weather event. But, he said, the absence of evidence didn‰??t mean a link doesn‰??t exist.‰??It‰??s a little bit like playing with a loaded gun here,‰? he said. ‰??Is it going to go off? Well maybe yes, maybe no. But you look at the typhoon that went into the Philippines ‰?" the strongest winds ever recorded on landfall. Is that climate change? I don‰??t know. But the atmosphere lined up with the ocean to create one of the strongest storms we‰??ve ever seen.‰?A precarious subjectEnvironmental groups frequently connect drought, wildfires and severe storms to climate change, and President Barack Obama has made those links a common theme in his efforts to put limits on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its latest report that there was ‰??low confidence‰? among the contributing scientists that climate change had made droughts longer or more intense since 1950 or led to increases in the intensity of tropical cyclone activity.The report said, however, that climate change likely led to an increase in heavy precipitation events and the amount of precipitation.Pielke said that floods in the United State have not increased in intensity or frequency since at least 1950 and that hurricane landfalls in the country have not increased in frequency, intensity or normalized damage since at least 1900.The federal government‰??s Storm Prediction Center, based in Norman, says the effect of climate change on tornado occurrence is unknown.‰??Climate models cannot resolve tornadoes or individual thunderstorms,‰? the center says on its webpage. ‰??They can indicate broad-scale shifts in three of the four favorable ingredients for severe thunderstorms (moisture, instability and wind shear), but as any severe weather forecaster can attest, having some favorable factors in place doesn‰??t guarantee tornadoes.‰?Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., said Wednesday that lawmakers should be focusing on the cumulative effects of climate change.‰??To focus only on the question of whether there will be more extreme events misses the point that by the end of this century, much of the world as we know it ... will be considerably altered by the weather effects of climate change,‰? she said.Pielke said the fact storms and droughts couldn‰??t be attributed to climate change didn‰??t mean human-caused climate change wasn‰??t real.‰??It does mean, however, that some activists, politicians, journalists, corporate and government agency representatives and even scientists who should know better have made claims that are unsupportable based on evidence and research,‰? he said.ClassificationLanguage:ÊENGLISHPublication-Type:ÊNewspaperSubject:ÊWEATHER (91%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); FLOODS & FLOODING (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); SEVERE WEATHER (90%); DROUGHT (89%); HURRICANES (89%); TROPICAL STORMS (87%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (78%); EARTH & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); TYPHOONS (78%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (76%); SCIENCE POLICY (76%); EMISSIONS (73%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); GREENHOUSE GASES (73%); MODELING & SIMULATION (73%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (72%); WILDFIRES (72%); NAVIES (66%); US NAVY (66%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (61%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (61%)Organization:ÊUNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (57%); UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA (56%); PENN STATE UNIVERSITY (55%);  US NAVY (55%)Industry:ÊGLOBAL WARMING (90%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (76%); EDUCATIONAL SERVICES (76%); EMISSIONS (73%); MODELING & SIMULATION (73%); NAVIES (66%); US NAVY (66%)Person:ÊBARACK OBAMA (79%)Geographic:ÊOKLAHOMA, USA (93%); UNITED STATES (93%); PHILIPPINES (79%)Load-Date:ÊFebruary 17, 2014End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 3 of 3Strong tornadoes not linked to climate change, experts say
