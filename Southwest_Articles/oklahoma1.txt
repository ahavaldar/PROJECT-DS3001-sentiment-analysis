Climate change talk subtle in stateThe Daily Oklahoman (Oklahoma City, OK)September 17, 2019 TuesdayCopyright 2019 The Daily Oklahoman, All Rights ReservedSection:ÊNEWSLength:Ê1283 wordsByline:ÊBy Carmen Forman Staff writer , cforman@oklahoman.comBodyAs scientists predict Oklahoma will face hotter temperatures and more extreme weather events as a result of climate change, the state's top elected officials largely aren't pushing legislation or policies to address it.Like other conservative states, Oklahoma is passing on sweeping climate laws and renewable energy mandates as climate change remains an outsized political issue at the national level.Talk of climate change - a political landmine in a state with close ties to fossil fuels - is nearly nonexistent at Oklahoma's Capitol.Nevertheless, the state known for the wind that comes sweeping down the plain has become a leader in wind energy.In Oklahoma, when state officials do discuss changing weather patterns and planning for future extreme weather events, there's a certain subtlety to the process.Climate change is a politically charged statement that people tend to shy away from in Oklahoma, said lobbyist Tyler Powell, who co-founded CSS Partners.Although climate issues were never a central policy theme when Powell was Oklahoma's deputy secretary of environment under former Gov. Mary Fallin, he said they were constantly planning for Oklahoma's weather future, whether that meant less water, hotter temperatures or more frequent incidences of drought and flooding.When the state was working on a comprehensive water plan, it was citizen input that led to development of the Water by 2060 plan, which calls for Oklahoma to use no more fresh water in 2060 than was used in 2012, Powell said."At the end of the day, I would argue, we are addressing how the environment in the state is evolving," he said.Oklahoma's becoming a leader in wind energy is part of that evolution. It is one of just four states that generates enough wind and solar power to cover at least 40% of the state's electricity needs, according to a recent report.Ken Wagner, Oklahoma's Secretary of Energy and Environment, said the state is quickly boosting its renewable energy output without any "radical" legislative or regulatory actions.Wagner pointed to California and New Mexico, which have enacted mandates requiring their utilities to generate 100% of electricity through renewable sources by 2050, as examples of states that have turned to harsh energy mandates."Without any regulatory response or any legislative action, we're leaders in the country," Wagner said.Yet Oklahoma is in stark contrast to many blue states where Democratic governors and legislative majorities have backed measures to move toward getting 100% of their electricity from renewable sources.Some Oklahomans think state leaders should take note.Oklahoma is woefully behind on addressing climate change that will inevitably boost temperatures across the state, worsen droughts and increase the number of wildfires, said Johnson Bridgewater, executive director of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club."Over the past decade, the state of Oklahoma has not lifted a finger as far as state government to truly address and get ahead of climate change and the impact that it will have on rural Oklahoma, especially farms and ranches," he said.Some Oklahoma legislators also have tried in recent years to actively deny climate change by attempting to keep climate science out of the classroom, Bridgewater said.Last year, Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, introduced legislation to permit teachers to introduce alternative scientific viewpoints in the classroom without getting fired.The bill, which was similar to legislation run by Bullard's predecessor, died in committee.A former history and government teacher, Bullard said he wanted students to learn there's another side to every argument.But Bullard doesn't want educators teaching just anything - he wants the information to be evidence-based and peer-reviewed. For example, on climate change, he said he's seen credible information saying climate change is real but not man-made.A United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030 to avoid catastrophic results to some parts of the planet.Bullard, a freshman senator, said he plans to reintroduce his legislation after some tweaks to make it more about academic freedom and less about controversial scientific topics.Legislators have not had much of an appetite to talk about climate change because they have been busy tackling more urgent issues, Bullard said."The needs of education have probably outweighed that discussion," he said. "I think the need to push our economy dominates that discussion. I think infrastructure in Oklahoma dominates that discussion. So really, there are just more pressing issues."As for what state government could be doing, Bridgewater said he wants Oklahoma leaders to commit to boosting Oklahoma's solar industry through tax credits and other avenues to help solar reach its full potential.Oklahoma is a top state for potential solar energy, but ranks among the worst states for actually adding the capacity.But the Sierra Club's first request is to see state leaders be upfront about the reality of climate change and say publicly that climate change is already affecting Oklahoma and the effects will get worse."We would certainly love to see our new governor actually state the fact that Oklahoma is experiencing, is going to be hit by climate change," Bridgewater said.In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt avoided using the term climate change, but he said Oklahoma is doing its part to be a good steward of the environment and will continue to promote clean air and clean water.State and local governments have the best chances of addressing climate and environmental concerns because they are closest to the citizens, he said.Stitt praised Oklahoma for being a leader in wind energy and natural gas production, so much so that Oklahoma exports its low-emissions energy to other states through the Southwest Power Pool."When liberal green states talk about emission reduction, Oklahoma is actually doing it and we are accomplishing it without heavy-handed, job-killing mandates," he said. "As governor, I am focused on positioning Oklahoma as the innovation hub for meeting America's energy demands of today and the future."Climate change is a global phenomenon, Wagner said, pointing to growing carbon emissions coming from nations like India and China.As for how Oklahoma can tackle the effects of climate change, the state must be able to adapt to any severe weather that might occur, Wagner said."It's making sure that we're the most adaptable and we have the most adaptive plans so when we do experience things like we experienced in the flood of 2019, regardless of the cause, we're resilient to it," he said.In Norman, residents don't plan on waiting for the state to act on climate change.Last year, the city became the first in Oklahoma to set a goal to transition to 100% renewable energy in city buildings by 2035 and using 100% renewable energy across the board by 2050.Young Oklahomans want to live in sustainable cities and if Norman can successfully lead the way, other cities and counties might implement similar sustainability measures, said Adrienne Gautier, a co-organizer for Ready for 100 Norman. Ready for 100 is a Sierra Club initiative."If Norman can succeed in some of these forward-thinking, forward-acting common-sense, business-friendly initiatives to embrace solar energy and wind energy then other cities will get inspired to do the same thing," she said. "Then, we could all join together and pressure the state to have more renewable-friendly laws."This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 220 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.ClassificationLanguage:ÊENGLISHPublication-Type:ÊNewspaperSubject:ÊWEATHER (91%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); FLOODS & FLOODING (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (90%); SEVERE WEATHER (90%); DROUGHT (89%); ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); GOVERNMENT PROCEDURE & LAWMAKING (78%); GOVERNORS (78%); LOBBYING (78%); PLATFORMS & ISSUES (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); ENERGY DEMAND (77%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (76%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (74%); EXECUTIVES (69%); WATER QUALITY (64%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (61%)Industry:ÊENERGY & UTILITIES (90%); ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT (89%); ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (89%); NATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); WIND ENERGY (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY DEMAND (77%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%)Person:ÊMARY FALLIN (58%)Geographic:ÊOKLAHOMA CITY, OK, USA (79%); OKLAHOMA, USA (99%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%)Load-Date:ÊSeptember 18, 2019End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 4 of 4Climate change talk subtle in state
