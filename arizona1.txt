Action needed on climate change to protect tourism, agricultureArizona Capitol TimesOctober 6, 2021 WednesdayCopyright 2021 BridgeTower Media All Rights ReservedSection:ÊNEWSLength:Ê501 wordsByline:ÊGuest OpinionBodyMy business, Bruzzi Vineyard, is based in Young. We also have a tasting room locatedin Superior. My regular commute between these two communities takes me through some of the most remote, wild, unspoiled lands in the state. This drive takes me across theSierra Ancha Mountains, through Tonto Basin, past Roosevelt Lake, and through the QueenCreek Canyon. This is one of the most spectacularly beautiful and relatively untouched parts ofthe lower 48, a stunning transition zone connecting the Sonoran Desert with the Mogollon Rim.Every day I notice something new - a black bear scampering across the road, an unnoticed rockformation hit in just the right light, skies of every color.While studying this landscape, wild as it is, environmental degradation is apparent. Tailings fromabandoned asbestos mines litter pristine mountainsides. Tailings from current mines pick up andblow in the wind. Smoke from wildfires obscures the vistas for months every year. Burn scarsstretch across an alarming percentage of the terrain. Invasive andnonnativeflora fill the openspaces. Large numbers of trees in the forest are dead from extended drought. The creeks andsprings that fill Roosevelt Lake run less and less. Make no mistake, these lands are rugged butthey are not resilient.Growing award winning wine grapes in the mountains of Arizona has an inherent series ofchallenges but we have seen weather related challenges increase over the last several years.Despite utilizing low water irrigation at our vineyard, drought has placed a strain on local wildlife,requiring a new fence to be built around our property to keep out hungry elk. Winters have lesssnow, frost comes later in the spring and earlier in the fall, and damaging hail is a regularoccurrence during monsoon storms. When it does rain it is often either too little or too much toofast to have true benefit.These trends continue year after year. Currently, around 10% of the Tonto National Forest isburned every year. These fires destroy iconic landscapes, historical resources and local tourism.The floods and burn scars continue after the fires for years, decades or longer. This year theTelegraph Fire came within miles of incinerating our tasting room in downtown Superior andthreatened the entire town of Superior as well as Miami, Globe and many smaller communities.Every year we live in fear of fire at ourYounglocation.Government action to prevent these fires on public land and to follow up and restore after thesefiresiscompletely insufficient. Climate change is not a theoretical debate where we live becauseit affects our lives every day. Our rural communities are all close neighbors with the NationalForests that surround us and we need action from our government representatives to addressclimate change and its many tragic effects. Our tourism and agriculture industries, a vital part ofour local economies, culture and heritage, depend on it.James Bruzziis owner ofBruzzi Vineyard.Copyright © 2021 BridgeTower Media.
