South Dakota Board of Education passes science standardsAberdeen American News (South Dakota)May 19, 2015 TuesdayCopyright 2015 Aberdeen American NewsDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection:ÊSTATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength:Ê516 wordsByline:ÊKatherine Grandstrand, American News, Aberdeen, S.D.BodyMay 19--The South Dakota State Board of Education passed new state standards for fine arts, technology and science at its regular meeting on Monday at Northern State University in Aberdeen.The new science standards garnered the most attention from those at the meeting and at previous public hearings.Climate change and evolution were two topics in the standards that brought some controversy.A group of South Dakotans joined a national group called Climate Parents and circulated petitions to gain support for the mention of climate change in the standards.During the meeting, Ruth Wegehaupt of Aberdeen delivered the petitions and spoke in favor of climate change education. But it was her 96-year-old mother who had telling testimony. Alice Wegehaupt stood up shortly before testimony was to close."I am 96 years old, going on 70 in September. If I live another three years, I'm going to have lived a century," Alice Wegehaupt said. "I am evident proof of a change in climate. ... I grew up on a farm north of Aberdeen. I have since lived in numerous places across the state and I've come back to South Dakota, and I can affirm the change in climate, especially in temperature. And I can also assure you that, if I live another century, which you might and might not, that there will have to be great changes made."Another part of the new science standards is to move further away from rote memorization -- a learning technique based on repetition -- to more experimentation by the students."Science is a subject that can only be taught effectively by doing," said Mark Iverson, a middle school science teacher in Watertown. "The proposed standards fully andcompletely encompass an effective teaching method and give educators the freedom and opportunity to offer experiences to students that foster their learning."Before passing the science standards, the board added an amendment paragraph to the introduction acknowledging the controversy surrounding the issues of climate change and evolution and parent involvement. It was proposed by state Secretary of Education Melody Schopp.The board also held a public hearing for new social studies standards, but due to the five-hearing policy for new standards, did not vote on the measure. The fifth hearing and vote are set for the July meeting.In other news:-- The board approved a health education major at Augustana College in Sioux Falls.The program will essentially be a double-major to be taken in conjunction with other education majors like physical education or family and consumer sciences, said Abby Javurek-Humig of the state Department of Education.-- The board heard concerns about Praxis test scores within the state, especially those of teachers seeking math endorsements. There was also discussion regarding the amount of tests some teachers, especially special education teachers, need to take.A Praxis test is a teacher certification exam.Follow @kgrandstrandAANon Twitter.___ (c)2015 the American News (Aberdeen, S.D.)
